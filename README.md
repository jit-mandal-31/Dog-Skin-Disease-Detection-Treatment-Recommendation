# Dog-Skin-Disease-Detection and Treatment-Recommendation

This project aims to help identify common skin diseases in dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built with MobileNetV2. The system classifies images into four categories—bacterial dermatosis, fungal infection, hypersensitivity dermatitis, and healthy—and recommends a set of medications or treatments based on veterinary best practices. It is designed to assist in early screening of street dogs or pets, especially in resource-limited settings where veterinary access is delayed.
